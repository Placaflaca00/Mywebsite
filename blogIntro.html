					<h2><u>My decision to disconnect from technology and the reasons behind it.</u> </h2>
				</header>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					Are you tired of feeling trapped in the endless cycle of scrolling through your phone? 
					Do you ever find yourself wondering where all those hours went, 
					and what you could have done with that time instead? I know I did.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: 23px;">That's why I decided to take control of my technology use and make a change.
					In the last days of 2022, I realized that I was spending an average of
					6 hours per day on my phone and it was time for a change. I knew that there were more important things
					I could be doing with my time.
				</p>		
					
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">I had the idea to completely disconnect from all social media,
					but it was a big decision and I found myself making excuses like
					"What if someone needs to reach me" or "What if a client needs to contact me"
					(even though I still had an active business). But then I realized that the only
					way to truly break free was to give up my phone, computer, and even my gaming controller
					to my mother so she could hide them away from me and make it easier for me to stay away.
				</p>
					
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					It was a bold move, but I knew it was necessary. I was ready to take back control of my time
 					and live my life on my own terms, not the terms set by my phone. And I was going to document
 					my journey in this blog, to share my experiences and the steps I took to break free from technology
 					and create a more productive and fulfilling life.
