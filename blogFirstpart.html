					<h2><u>Planning and preparation: My plan for disconnecting from technology and creating a productive routine.</u> </h2>
				</header>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					With the determination to break free from the constant distraction and dependence on technology,
 					I set a specific date for my disconnection journey to begin. January 2nd, 2023 -
 					a fresh start for the new year and a new me. I knew that starting on a Monday would be best,
				    as I didn't want to spend my New Year's Eve without my phone and not a boring Sunday.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					But before diving headfirst into my plan, I knew I needed to prepare myself for the challenges
					that lay ahead. The first step was to decide on a clear objective - to not only reduce my screen 
					time but to completely disconnect from my phone and other electronic devices. 
					This meant logging out of all my Google accounts on my computer to limit access to social media, 
					streaming platforms and other distractions.
				</p>		
					
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					To make this transition as smooth as possible, I created a detailed daily routine on paper.
 					Starting with my morning habits - waking up early, hitting the gym, and having a healthy breakfast
 					- to my afternoon and evening activities, such as boxing and spending quality time with my loved ones.
 					I made sure to schedule in time for self-care and relaxation, knowing that disconnecting from technology
 					can be overwhelming at times.

				</p>
					
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					But I also knew that my plan wasn't just about limiting my screen time - 
					it was about making the most of my time offline. I set a goal to learn something new and improve my skills,
 					whether it be programming or any other interest.
				</p>
				
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					As the clock struck 2:14 am, I knew it was time to take action.
 					I said goodbye to my friend and left my phone, computer,
 					and gaming controller on the table for my mother to hide away.
 					I wanted to fall asleep quickly, without the anxiety of what the next day would bring and without
 					the temptation of picking up my devices. With everything in place and a clear plan in mind,
 					I was ready to begin my disconnection journey.
