					<h2><u>Results and achievements: The positive effects of disconnecting from technology on my life
					 and the changes I have observed in myself.</u>
					</h2>
				</header>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					The experience of disconnecting from technology was one of the most transformative moments of my life.
 					Not only did I achieve a newfound sense of peace and tranquility,
					but I also discovered a host of new opportunities and experiences.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					One of the most striking achievements was the realization that my phone had been consuming
					a significant portion of my time and attention. Without the constant distractions of social media and videos,
 					I was able to focus on the present moment and appreciate the small things in life.
 					I also found myself going out more often, visiting friends and family,
 					and enjoying activities that I had previously neglected.

				</p>		
					
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					Another major benefit was the boost in my physical and mental well-being.
					I took up sports and exercise, and found that the only way to experience
					a high level of dopamine was through the endorphins released during physical activity.
					Additionally, I picked up reading again and started studying Java, preparing for the fifth semester.
				</p>
					
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					But perhaps the most rewarding outcome of this experience was the creation
 					of my own website and personal blog. It was a chance to share my story and connect
 					with others who may also be looking to disconnect and find a new perspective.

				</p>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">
					If you're considering taking the leap and disconnecting from technology,
					I highly recommend it. It's an experience that will change your life and open up a world of new possibilities.
					If you have any questions or want to know more about my journey, please don't hesitate to reach out and contact me.
