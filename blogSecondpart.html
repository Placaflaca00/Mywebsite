					<h2><u> The transition period:My experience of disconnecting from technology and the challenges faced.</u> </h2>
				</header>
				<h1 style="font-size: 23px;">Day 1: A New Beginning or an End?</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">					
					As I stepped out of the store, phone-less and feeling a mix of fear and excitement,
 					I couldn't help but feel a void in my heart. It was as if a part of me was missing.
 					But I knew deep down that this was the first step towards something greater.
				</p>

				<h1 style="font-size: 23px;">Days 2 and 3: The Struggle is Real</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">					
					The first few days were tough. I had to adapt to a new routine without my phone, and it was a struggle.
 					I felt like I had lost my identity. But as I stuck to my habits, things started to get easier.
 					The panic attacks subsided and I started to feel a sense of control over my life.
				</p>	
					
				<h1 style="font-size: 23px;">Days 4 and 5: Acceptance and Realization</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">		
					By the fourth day, I started to accept the fact that I was going to be without my phone for a while.
 					And that's when I realized how much time I had been wasting on social media and watching videos on YouTube.
 					I started to watch television again, but avoided platforms like Netflix and Spotify. On the fifth day,
					I felt genuinely happy and content without my phone. I had the mentality that on the 6th, which was a Saturday,
					I would only use my computer for work.
				</p>
					
				<h1 style="font-size: 23px;">Days 6 and Beyond: The Power of Time</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 23px;">		
					The next few days were a blur. Time moved at a snail's pace, and it felt like a month had gone by.
					I had my computer and my gaming controller, but I didn't use them as much as I used to.
					I had achieved something that I never thought was possible. I had broken free from the shackles of technology and
					reclaimed my time and my life.
